# 🏗 scaffold-eth gets optimistic

> [optimism](https://optimism.io/) proof-of-concept

## quickstart

```bash
git clone -b local-optimism https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git local-optimism

cd local-optimism
```

```bash

yarn install

```

```bash

yarn start

```

> in a second terminal window:

__This requires Docker__

Initiate the Optimism submodules...
```bash
cd local-optimism/docker/optimism-integration
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Kick off the local chain, l2 & relay infrastructure (it kind of feels like a space-ship taking off)
```bash
cd local-optimism/docker/optimism-integration
make up
```

### Deploying contracts!
This branch has several contracts

`YourContract.sol` -> L2
An amended version of the basic YourContract that comes with scaffold-eth

`ERC20.sol` -> L1
An ERC20 contract with a `mint(value)` function that allows any user to mint themselve some tokens

`L1ERC20Gateway.sol`
The example Optimism L1 Gateway contracts

`L2DepositedERC20.sol`
The example Optimism L2 Deposited ERC20 contract

__Kudos & thanks to the Optimistic Ethereum team whose [erc20 example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/deposit-withdrawal) this benefited from!__

> in a third terminal window, generate a local account:

```bash
cd local-optimism
yarn generate
```
Send that account some ETH using the faucet from http://localhost:3000/ to fund the deployments

> when the local nodes are up and running, deploy local contracts & attempt to go from L1 -> L2 and back again!
```
yarn deploy-oe
```

### Changes to the hardhat setup on this branch...
We import the following into our `hardhat.config.js`:
```
require('@eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/compiler');
require('@eth-optimism/plugins/hardhat/ethers');
```
We created a dedicated `oe-deploy.js`, and split out our `deploy()` function in `utils.js` such that it can deploy on the EVM or the OVM.

`oe-deploy.js` instantiates using the specified network (currently `localhost` or `kovan`), deploys the above contracts, tying the bridged ERC20s, initialises the `OVM_L2DepositedERC20`, and then if `demo == true`, it demonstrates the L1->L2->L1 ERC20 bridging.

We use `const { Watcher } = require('@eth-optimism/watcher')` which monitors the relayed messages between L1 and L2.

Note that we are not able to use hardhat's usual accounts, so we use scaffold-eth's account generation...

### frontend
There are three tabs:
- ETH bridging to Optimistic Eth (send yourself some L1 ETH with the faucet!) & send ETH on L1 & L2
- YourContract on L2
- OldEnglish ERC20 & Bridge contracts (make sure you approve the Gateway to bridge!)

------------------------

### Working Notes
- Is OE eompatible with hardhat config accounts? I had to instantiate in my deploy script
- Get a silent failure on L2 if I don't reset the nonces in Metamask
- Using OpenZeppelin contracts that import their Address.sol break:
```OVM Compiler Error (silence by adding: "// @unsupported: ovm" to the top of this file):
 @openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol:115:17: ParserError: OVM: SELFBALANCE is not implemented in the OVM. (We have no native ETH -- use deposited WETH instead!)
        require(address(this).balance >= value, "Address: insufficient balance for call");
```
- Get a failure on OZ Safemint (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-bytes-)
- Avoiding silent failures - the initial tx response doesn't give you an indication as to whether a transaction has succeeded or failed, you need to add:
```
await result.wait()
```
Which will then throw an error. This is different to the EVM, where the initial await transactionResponse will throw.
- Including a {value: amount} field in ovm .sol doesn't seem to throw?
- Time on L2 only updates when there is a transaction from L1 -> L2
