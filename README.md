This will take you to a populated transaction create page:

You will see the new transaction in the pool (this is all off-chain):

> Give your account some gas at the faucet and execute the transaction

The transction will appear as "executed" on the front page:

This time we will need a second signature:

(You'll notice you don't need ⛽️gas to sign transactions.)

> Execute the transction to transfer the funds:

(You might need to trigger a new block by sending yourself some faucet funds or something. HartHat blocks only get mined when there is a transaction.)

💼 Edit your deployment script `deploy.js` in `packages/hardhat/scripts`

## ⚔️ Side Quests

#### 🐟 Create custom signer roles for your Wallet
You may not want every signer to create new transfers, only allow them to sign existing transactions or a mega-admin role who will be able to veto any transaction.

#### 😎 Integrate this MultiSig wallet into other branches like nifty-ink  
Make a MultiSig wallet to store your precious doodle-NFTs!?
