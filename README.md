## Development

The code structure now looks/works like this:

There are global game objects (some have actions which can be accessed and called from within all 'level' components):

- Terminal
- Wallet
- GameBackground [setBackground()]
- Dialog [setCurrentDialog(), setCurrentDialog()]
- Level [setCurrentLevel()]

There is a levels folder that will contain one folder for each game level/story
The content of these folders is structured in the following way:

- view/LevelContainerContent
  - the components and their logic are mapped into the global game screen
  - (in the underflow level the smart contract window goes here)
- view/TerminalContent
  - the components and their logic are mapped into the Terminal component
- view/WalletContent
  - the components and their logic are mapped into the Wallet component
- model/dialog
  - contains a json structure that defines the levels story flow (atm. mostly dialogs)
  - are aggregated in the global Dialog controller

### Deploy to surge
